# Pong-on-8x8-Matrix-Display

Programmed on an 8x8 LED matrix with use of an Arduino microcontroller.
Switches act as button-controllers to move paddles for two players.
Buttons can be used to change direction of paddle through rapid clicking, subject to a time threshold.
Modifications in code may be necessary for different configurations of anode and cathode pins into matrix.
Attached is an Excel spreadsheet for setting up and troubleshooting various patterns of LEDS in terms of the corresponding pin states.
