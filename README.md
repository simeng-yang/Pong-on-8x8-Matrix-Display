# Pong-on-8x8-Matrix-Display

Programmed on Arduino Uno and connected breadboard. 
Display is shown on 8x8 Matrix. 
Switches act as button-controllers to move paddles. 
Buttons can be used to change direction of paddle through rapid clicking. 
Pins can be freely adjusted, up to physical constraints of Arduino and breadboard. 
Accompanying modifications in code may be necessary for changing of pins.
